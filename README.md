# Heart-Disease-Predictor
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various health attributes such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and exercise-related factors. Using machine learning models, the goal is to classify whether a person is at risk of heart disease or not, leveraging a dataset with multiple health features.
