# Heart-Disease-Predictor
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various health attributes such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and exercise-related factors. Using machine learning models, the goal is to classify whether a person is at risk of heart disease or not, leveraging a dataset with multiple health features.


The project uses the Heart Disease Dataset, which includes patient data such as:

Resting blood pressure (trestbps)
Serum cholesterol levels (chol)
Fasting blood sugar (fbs)
Electrocardiographic results (restecg)
Maximum heart rate achieved (thalach)
Exercise-induced angina (exang)
The goal is to classify individuals as either having a heart disease (target = 1) or not (target = 0), using machine learning algorithms.

Pandas: For data manipulation and handling.
NumPy: For numerical operations and array handling.
Matplotlib: For creating visualizations like ROC curves.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree) and performance evaluation metrics (accuracy, ROC-AUC).
